    <p> 
        I am student at CU Boulder, majoring in Creative Technology and Design, and minoring in both Computer Science and Art Practices.
        I am interested in the intersection between creative and technical fields, with applications in areas such as video game development.
        I have experience with Python, Java, and C++, and I am continuously growing my skillset.
        I also have experience with Photoshop and Illustrator.

        I was born and raised in Colorado, which likely played a large role in a large number of things which I like doing.
        I enjoy pretty much all things nature, whether that is hiking, biking, skiing, etc. I generally like spending time outdoors, and I love getting fresh air.
